# 👋 Hi, I'm Alex — AI Engineer & Software Engineer  
Building production-ready AI systems that connect business data with LLMs.

---

### ⚡ What I Do
I design, build, and deploy **AI-powered applications end-to-end** —  
from RAG pipelines and APIs (Python/FastAPI, Node/Nest) to frontends in Next.js.  
Focused on measurable impact: **accuracy, latency, and cost per query.**

---

### 🧩 Tech Stack
**AI / LLMs:** OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, LlamaIndex  
**Backend:** FastAPI, NestJS, Node.js, Python  
**Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind  
**Data:** Postgres + pgvector, Redis, Pinecone  
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, ECS, RDS, API Gateway, CloudFront)  
**Monitoring:** OpenTelemetry, CloudWatch, Grafana

---

### 🚀 Selected Projects
- **AI Support Assistant** — Internal RAG system with sources, metrics & feedback loop  
- **DocInsight** — Automated document analysis & summarization dashboard (Next.js + FastAPI)  
- **AI Product Evaluator** — LLM benchmarking for latency, cost, and accuracy tracking  

*(Projects focus on real-world use of LLMs with data, not just demos.)*

---

### 📈 What I Care About
✅ Real metrics (accuracy, latency, $/query)  
✅ Secure data handling (PII hygiene, IAM, guardrails)  
✅ Fast iteration & deployment (CI/CD, observability)
